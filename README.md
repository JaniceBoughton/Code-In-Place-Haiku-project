#Code-In-Place-Haiku-project: this is my final project for CodeInPlace, the Python course.
The code creates first a Haiku from random words and phrases I put in lists, then a Haiku about a python. Then it uses the simple graphics program from the course to draw a refrigerator and post the haiku on the refrigerator, like a refrigerator magnet.
